# Origami
An open-source, web-based Magiser 6 client.

## Code style

* Use the `;` at the end of your line: `console.log("hello");`.
* When you install and use something, save it to package.json (`npm install <package> --save`)
* Use comments, other people are going to read this code too! ( `#this does cool stuff`)
* More coming soon
